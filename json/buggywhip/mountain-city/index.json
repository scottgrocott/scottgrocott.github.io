The primary location is the 'A.O.K. Kampground' this camping facility is a more affordable, open to everyone (meaning all makes and models of cars). The campground,is ajacent to a giant recreational area for auto enthusiasts. Campers bring their vehicle to enjoy all kinds of auto performance activity.",
        "Act 2 Takes our main character from the outskirts into the heart of Mountain City. Here, the protagonist uncovers deeper conspiracies involving the powerful automotive families that control the city. High-speed chases through neon-lit streets, daring escapes, and intense confrontations define this act.This culminates in a showdown with leader of the Ferrari family, revealing their plans to monopolize the city's automotive industry.",
        "Act 3 Adds the final twist in that the city is taken over by a new more powerful boss.'Chad Boss' to be exact. Chad moves in with his Lamborghini operation (up until this point in the series Lamborghini has not be seen or spoken of because Chad had not been called in yet) and begins to battle the powers that be to get the city under his control in a high-stakes showdown that reshapes Mountain City."
