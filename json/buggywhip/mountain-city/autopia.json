	"town_dessert-flat":["Desert Flats.Desert Flats-sounds like this vast, sun-baked expanse just past Mountain City's edges, where the land stretches out flat and endless, dotted with wind-worn rocks and forgotten trails. It's got that lonely, timeless feel, right? The kind of place where old ranches cling to life, dust devils dance in the heat, and maybe a lone inventor tinkers in a shed full of half-finished machines. ",
"the racing scene fits perfectly, turning those endless flats into a high-stakes playground for speed junkies and daredevils. Imagine souped-up mini hot rods barreling across the salt, kicking up dust clouds that shimmer in the heat, crowds gathered under patched-up awnings, betting on who'll make it to the end without their engine seizing from the dust."],
		"city_bay-city":["Bay City-coastal counterpart to Mountain City's inland vibes. A miniature port town. Bay's the living room, where inland and coast share space on one tiny peninsula. Mountains frame it, but the water's what makes it breathe.",
		"Bay City-miniature coastal racing town. Drift culture rules here, with cars screeching around tight bends, drifting sideways past neon lights and harbor cranes, salt air mixing with tire smoke."],
		"city_harbor-town":["Harbor Town-Bay City's rough-and-tumble cousin. The kind of dockside sprawl where the air's thick with salt, diesel, and low-end bass. Muscle cars are kings here, their V8s rumbling like thunder off rusted freighters. This is where every car on the island continent makes landfall-creaking gangways, tarps flapping in the salt wind. Cars roll down planks straight into the grit, tires hissing against wet concrete, grease and sweat in the air as mechanics and drivers size each other up before the first race even starts."],
		"town_canyon-crossing":["Canyon Crossing-that's the wild frontier carved into Autopia's craggy spine. Imagine endless red rock canyons, wide enough to swallow whole RV convoys and dotted with switchback trails where 4x4s claw their way up sheer cliffs, tires spitting gravel and dust. It's a haven for off-road junkies, those rugged souls who live for the roar of a big-block diesel echoing off canyon walls, the thrill of jumping ravines in tricked-out rigs. Picture massive campfires under star-drenched skies, RVs parked in half-moon clusters like tiny pioneer settlements, and dust trails marking the paths of the latest canyon daredevils. This is where sanity takes a backseat to the pull of the wild"],
		"town_everglades-jungle":["Everglades Jungle-the humid, pulse-quickening heart of Autopia's night scene, a twisted mashup of tangled mangroves, glowing neon, and full-moon key to key style small connected island races."]

	      "The Dynasty Class":[
	  "Dynasties treat fabbers like secret weapons. The families – Tortellini with their Ferraris, Boss and Lambos, Nakamura with Toyotas – court them hard, offering rare parts, prime workshop space, and protection in exchange for exclusivity. A single fabber can tip a turf war or championship by unveiling a beast no one else can match. In return, dynasties shield them from rivals, sometimes even from the law, because losing a top fabber could mean losing everything.",
	  "The dynasties don't just operate law enforcement; they own it. Cops are basically private security on steroids, funded and directed by the families. In Port Injection, you've got Lamborghini Huracans for highways and Dodge Chargers for busting boring haulers. Up in the Apex Peaks, off-road Raptors hunt down anyone messing with the touge runs. These cops aren't about public safety – they're enforcers for the dynasties' territories. They pull over unmodified cars, protect race routes, and break up rival family operations. The law in Autopia is just another tool for the dynasties to maintain their power and crush any threats to their automotive empires."
	  ],
      "The Fabricators (Top tier - those who build)":[
	  "Fabbers are the absolute elite, the genius builders who don't just mod, but actually create rides from the ground up. They're the ones who turn scrap and smarts into legendary cars that rule the dynasties. Fabbers are scarce, worshipped almost like prophets in Autopia. They design the next generation of speed beasts, the ones that win championships and power plays. Owning a Fabber's creation? That's the ultimate flex on the island."
	  ],
      "The Tuners (Middle tier - those who improve)":[
	  "Tuners are the middle class magicians, taking stock cars and turning them into fire-breathing monsters. They're the ones who know every nut, bolt, and line of nitrous that flows through the veins of a dynastic ride. Their job is to customize, upgrade, and optimize vehicles for peak performance or show. In Autopia, a tuner's reputation is everything; one bad build can cost a dynasty a race or a war."
	  ],
      "The Drivers (Working class - those who operate)":[
	  "The drivers are the muscle of Autopia, the ones who actually race and show off. They're employees of the dynasties, trading their skills behind the wheel for protection and status. You see them piloting modified beasts in street races, dynastic showcases, or as getaway drivers in turf wars. Their job's to dominate the road, win races for their family, or sometimes just intimidate rivals with sheer speed and presence."
	  ],
      "The Commuters (Lowest class - those who drive purely for transport)":[
	  "The low-tier commuters get shoved to the fringes of each zone. In Port Injection, it's the squat sprawl of garages on the outskirts, where neon fades to grime. Gasket Gulch's dustbowls have their ramshackle trailer parks, far from Rust Valhalla's action. Up in Apex Peaks, they're stuck in the lower switchbacks, watching the touge kings from below. Torque Timberlands' mud bogs have basic cabins for them, and Velocity Flats' salt edges hold prefab sheds. Always on the outskirts, near the action but never in the spotlight.",
	  "They handle the grunt work – tow-truck drivers, tire scrappers, body shop sweeps, oil changers, or just parking-lot attendants. Sometimes they run errands for the dynasties, hauling parts or cleaning up after races. It's all the dirty jobs the tuners and fabbers won't touch"
