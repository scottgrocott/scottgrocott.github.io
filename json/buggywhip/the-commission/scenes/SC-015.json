    "author": "Martin Jenkins",
    "summary": "Martin’s article recounts the podcast experience, initially describing Jason as a presumed dimwit—consistent with Martin’s harsh editorial persona. Across the article, however, Martin acknowledges Jason’s above-average intellect, thoughtful process, and a painting that 'grew on him'. He compares the work to process-driven artists of the Painters Painting era. The article concludes with a mix of alcohol-driven honesty and reluctant admiration.",

      "I had the opportunity to sit with Jason Towne on my podcast to discuss his artwork, his thoughts, and have a deluge of scrumptious Pinot Noir.",
      "We began our conversation with my certainty of Jason’s dim wit. As my readers know, I do this with all artists. The artist gets no benefit of the doubt from me until we speak. The artist gets no freebies. You are an idiot, or you’re not. My assumption is firmly grounded in this reality—most artists are imbeciles. If you take offense to this—you might be stupid too.",
      "Jason’s newest painting was present for our conversation. It had an effect on me. The coloration was striking... several notches away from magnificent, but it works well enough.",
      "Jason dispelled my assumption that he possesses a dimwit. He is quite normal—his intellect is a smidge above average. Jason should receive this praise as a high honor.",
      "His focus on layered process reminds me of the documentary Painters Painting—an era when artists cared about expression rather than fame.",
      "Jason’s painting began to grow on me as we spoke. This frequently happens. A work whispers to be viewed again. Given enough time, it might surprise us.",
      "Jason also helped me drop my shield enough to take in his work on a deeper level. Or perhaps the Pinot Noir did. Until next time, keep the drinks flowing. —Martin Jenkins"
